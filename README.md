# allennlp-distributed-training

This repo holds code/config for running example AllenNLP experiments with `DistributedDataParallel` support.
The `training_config` directory has two versions of the same set of experiments. The ones in `distributed_data_parallel` 
directory mostly differs with the dataset readers. The dataset readers are replicas of the original ones in AllenNLP, 
with a minor modification to support distributed sampling.

To run the distributed experiments install AllenNLP:

```bash
conda create -n allennlp_distributed python=3.7
conda activate allennlp_distributed
git clone https://github.com/allenai/allennlp
cd allennlp
pip install .
```  

And run:

`allennlp train training_config/distributed_data_parallel/esim.jsonnet --include-package distributed-training -s output/`

To run without distributed setup, do the usual AllenNLP installation and use experiments in `training_config/ data_parallel/`

#### Speed Comparison: Time taken to train one epoch (averaged over 3 epochs) 

GPU - 2080 Ti

NOTE: The time reported **does not** correspond to the `training_duration` metric. This is the time taken by the `Trainer._train_epoch` method.
